## Lectures

We will use a combination of typed lecture notes, and [QuantEcon Lecture Notes](https://lectures.quantecon.org/jl/)

1. **January 3rd** -  [Deterministic Difference Equations](/lecture_notes/deterministic_difference_equations.pdf) and maybe starting [Linear Models](https://lectures.quantecon.org/jl/linear_models.html)
2. **January 8th** - [Linear Models](https://lectures.quantecon.org/jl/linear_models.html)
    - With [Additional Examples](/lecture_notes/linear_models_addendum.pdf)
3. **January 10th** - Julia Review Session
    - Start going through [Learning Julia](https://lectures.quantecon.org/jl/learning_julia.html) and plan to complete it in January
    - Make sure to go through the  [Julia Instructions](https://github.com/econtoolkit/julia) for our setup suggestions (although could also go through and instructions instead of the [Setting up Julia](https://plectures.quantecon.org/jl/getting_started.html) in QuantEcon)
    - Make sure you go through [Introductory Example](https://lectures.quantecon.org/jl/julia_by_example.html) and [Julia Essentials](https://lectures.quantecon.org/jl/julia_essentials.html) and [Vectors, Arrays, and Matrices](https://lectures.quantecon.org/jl/julia_arrays.html)
4. **January 15th** - Finish [Linear Models](https://lectures.quantecon.org/jl/linear_models.html) and [Additional Examples](/lecture_notes/linear_models_addendum.pdf) and start [Linear Quadratic Control](https://lectures.quantecon.org/jl/lqcontrol.html)
5. **January 17th** - [Linear Quadratic Control](https://lectures.quantecon.org/jl/lqcontrol.html)
    - With [Additional Material](/lecture_notes/linear_quadratic_control_addendum.pdf)
6. **January 22nd** - Solving stochastic difference equations in Dynare and Julia
7. **January 24th** - [Rational and Adaptive Expectations](/lecture_notes/rational_adaptive_expectations.pdf) and [Global and Local Solutions](/lecture_notes/global_local_solutions.pdf)
8. **January 29th** - Finish [Global and Local Solutions](/lecture_notes/global_local_solutions.pdf)
9. **January 31th** - [Real Business Cycles](/lecture_notes/real_business_cycles.pdf) and start [Monopolistic Competition](/lecture_notes/monopolistic_competition.pdf)
10. **February 5th** - [Monopolistic Competition](/lecture_notes/monopolistic_competition.pdf) and maybe start [Money in Utility](/lecture_notes/money_in_utility.pdf)
11. **February 7th** - [Money in Utility](/lecture_notes/money_in_utility.pdf)
