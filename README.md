## Syllabus
See [Syllabus](syllabus.md) for more details

## Lectures

We will use a combination of typed lecture notes, and [QuantEcon Lecture Notes](https://lectures.quantecon.org/jl/)

1. **January 3rd** -  [Deterministic Difference Equations](/lecture_notes/deterministic_difference_equations.pdf) and maybe starting [Linear Models](https://lectures.quantecon.org/jl/linear_models.html)
2. **January 8th** - [Linear Models](https://lectures.quantecon.org/jl/linear_models.html)
    - With [Additional Examples](/lecture_notes/linear_models_addendum.pdf)
3. **January 10th** - Julia Review Session
    - Start going through [Learning Julia](https://lectures.quantecon.org/jl/learning_julia.html) and plan to complete it in January
    - Make sure to go through the  [Julia Instructions](https://github.com/econtoolkit/julia) for our setup suggestions (although could also go through and instructions instead of the [Setting up Julia](https://lectures.quantecon.org/jl/getting_started.html) in QuantEcon)
    - Make sure you go through [Introductory Example](https://lectures.quantecon.org/jl/julia_by_example.html) and [Julia Essentials](https://lectures.quantecon.org/jl/julia_essentials.html) and [Vectors, Arrays, and Matrices](https://lectures.quantecon.org/jl/julia_arrays.html)
4. **January 15th** - Finish [Linear Models](https://lectures.quantecon.org/jl/linear_models.html) and [Additional Examples](/lecture_notes/linear_models_addendum.pdf) and start [Linear Quadratic Control](https://lectures.quantecon.org/jl/lqcontrol.html)
5. **January 17th** - Finish [Linear Quadratic Control](https://lectures.quantecon.org/jl/lqcontrol.html)

## Problem Sets

1. **Due January 31st** - [Assignment 1](/problem_sets/assignment_1.pdf)

Unless otherwise specified, computational problem sets are to be sent as
- A Jupyter `.ipynb` notebook and a `.pdf` output of the notebook.  To get the `.pdf` in JuliaBox, etc. you can just `Print` to a `.pdf` file
- The naming convention for student `Jane Doe` submitting assignment `1` is `Doe_Jane_assignemnt_1.ipynb` and `Doe_Jane_assignemnt_1.pdf`, etc.
- Please do not submit a zipped folder, and please follow the naming conventions of the files to make it easier to follow
- Remember that you can type LaTeX into your `.ipynb` files, so please document any formulas/etc. as Markdown cells with math.
- Where possible, try to use notation in the code which matches the math.  e.g. for parameter alpha, type as variable `\alpha` to generate the Unicode symbol as the variable name.
