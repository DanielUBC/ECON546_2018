## Lectures

We will use a combination of typed lecture notes, and [QuantEcon Lecture Notes](https://lectures.quantecon.org/jl/)

1. **January 3rd** -  [Deterministic Difference Equations](/lecture_notes/deterministic_difference_equations.pdf) and maybe starting [Linear Models](https://lectures.quantecon.org/jl/linear_models.html)
1. **January 8th** - [Linear Models](https://lectures.quantecon.org/jl/linear_models.html)
    - With [Additional Examples](/lecture_notes/linear_models_addendum.pdf)
1. **January 10th** - Julia Review Session 
    - Start going through [Learning Julia](https://lectures.quantecon.org/jl/learning_julia.html) and plan to complete it in January
    - Make sure to go through the  [Julia Instructions](https://github.com/econtoolkit/julia) for our setup suggestions (although could also go through and instructions instead of the [Setting up Julia](https://lectures.quantecon.org/jl/getting_started.html) in QuantEcon)
    - Make sure you go through [Introductory Example](https://lectures.quantecon.org/jl/julia_by_example.html) and [Julia Essentials](https://lectures.quantecon.org/jl/julia_essentials.html) and [Vectors, Arrays, and Matrices](https://lectures.quantecon.org/jl/julia_arrays.html)
